# Chat-with-PDF-using-Groq-LLM
This project is an interactive PDF-based chatbot that allows users to upload one or more PDF documents and ask questions based on their content. It uses Groqâ€™s LLM (e.g., Gemma2-9b-It) for answering questions with detailed and context-aware responses, and sentence-transformer embeddings with ChromaDB for efficient semantic search.
